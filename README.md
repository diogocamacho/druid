# DRUID: DRUg Indication Discoverer

DRUID, or DRUg Indication Discoverer, is an algorithm that identifies drug profiles that revert or mimic a condition of interest.  For example, DRUID can be used to repurpose compounds for novel indications given a gene expression profile, it can be used to prioritize compounds for a compendium of disease states, and it can be incorporated into computational chemistry pipelines for the identification and characterization of drug properties for novel design.
